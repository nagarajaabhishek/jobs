# Research: US University Career Portals Market Landscape

## 1. Market Share & The "Big Three" Vendors

The US university career portal market is heavily consolidated, primarily dominated by two major players and one strong niche competitor.

### A. Handshake (The Incumbent Volume Leader)
- **Market Penetration:** Claims over 1,000 university partners, including **80% of the top 500 universities** in the United States.
- **User Base:** 17+ million students/alumni and nearly 500,000 employers (including all Fortune 500 companies).
- **Core Strategy:** A two-sided marketplace optimizing for sheer volume. It is highly US-centric (over 97% of its customer base is in the US).

### B. Symplicity CSM (The Legacy Enterprise Leader)
- **Market Penetration:** Claims to be the longest-standing market leader, actively used by **70% of the top universities** in the U.S. and over 1,300 career centers globally.
- **User Base:** 34 million students/alumni database (historic data).
- **Core Strategy:** Positions itself as a more robust, highly customizable enterprise solution for universities compared to Handshake's standardized student-app interface.

### C. 12Twenty (The Premium/Grad-School Niche)
- **Market Penetration:** Used by more than 50 of the top 100 universities, but holds a massive monopoly in graduate programs (over half of the top 25 MBA programs and six of the top 25 law schools in the US).
- **Core Strategy:** Focuses heavily on **data analytics, career outcome reporting, and highly curated employer networks** rather than the "spray and pray" volume model of Handshake.

## 2. The "Homegrown" Portal Phenomenon
Instead of paying Handshake or Symplicity, some universities choose to build and maintain their own proprietary career portals. 

### Why Universities Build Homegrown Portals (The Value Prop)
1. **Curriculum/Data Integration:** They want deep integration with their own Learning Management Systems (Canvas/Blackboard) and student transcript databases to track exact student outcomes (which third-party vendors can't natively access).
2. **The "Shadow Market":** To foster direct, exclusive pipelines with local regional employers and specific alumni donors without those jobs getting drowned out in a national Handshake feed.
3. **Control over Analytics:** Total ownership over First Destination Survey (FDS) data used for accreditation (ABET, AACSB) and securing university funding.

### The Drawbacks to Homegrown Systems (Why they fail)
1. **The Resource Trap:** Universities severely underestimate the cost of software maintenance. These portals quickly become static, outdated, and clunky.
2. **The "Empty Room" Problem:** Because the UI/UX is often poor compared to VC-backed consumer apps, student adoption plummets. Studies show many homegrown portals suffer from extremely low utilization rates.
3. **Employer Friction:** A recruiter at Microsoft does not want to create 50 different login credentials for 50 different homegrown university portals. They prefer Handshake because one posting goes to 1,000 schools instantly.

## 3. Strategic Takeaway for Our Application
This research heavily validates our **"Layer, Don't Replace"** strategy. 

We should **not** try to build a new jobs portal to replace Handshake or a homegrown system. 
Instead, our app acts as an **Intelligence/Evaluation Layer** that sits *on top* of them:
1. A student finds a job on Handshake (The Sourcing Layer).
2. The student copies the URL/JD into our App.
3. Our App maps that JD against the student's verified university syllabus (The Verification Layer) and tells them what they are missing.
4. The University buys our anonymized aggregate data to see *why* their students are failing Handshake applications.
