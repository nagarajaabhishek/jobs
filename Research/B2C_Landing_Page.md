# B2C Landing Page Copy: For Students

## Hero Section
**Headline:** Stop Guessing. Start Interviewing.
**Sub-headline:** The only job feed that instantly tells you if you're a fit, which resume to use, and exactly who hired your classmates last year.
**Call to Action (CTA):** Get Your Pre-Evaluated Feed (Free for UT Students)
**Visual/Mockup:** A clean, split-screen UI. Left side: The student's 3 resumes (TPM, BA, Manager). Right side: A single job listing with a glowing badge: *"92% Verified Match. Use the Business Analyst Resume."*

## Section 1: The Problem (Agitation)
**Headline:** Applying to jobs shouldn't feel like a black hole.
**Three Columns:**
1. **Platform Fatigue:** Checking 5 different job boards every morning and seeing the same 50 "Ghost Jobs."
2. **The Output Guessing Game:** Spending 20 minutes tweaking your resume for a job you were never going to get anyway.
3. **The AI Spam Trap:** Using ChatGPT to rewrite your bullets until they sound like everyone else. Recruiters know, and they are filtering you out.

## Section 2: The Solution (The "Frictionless" USP)
**Headline:** Zero Copy-Pasting. Zero Guesswork. 
**Paragraph:** Welcome to the Frictionless Pipeline. We don't just show you jobs. Our background intelligence engine automatically maps every new job against *all* of your different resume profiles simultaneously.
**Sub-Features (Icon + Text):**
- **The Centralized Daily Feed:** We scrape target company career pages every morning. You see the top 100 actual, open roles in one place.
- **The LLM Router:** We don't just give you a "score." We tell you *exactly* which of your specific resumes yields the highest probability of an interview.
- **Verified Gaps, Not Generic Rejections:** If you aren't a fit, we don't just say "No." We tell you exactly which verified university course you need to take to bridge the gap.

## Section 3: The Secret Weapon (The "Warm Sourcing" USP)
**Headline:** Turn Cold Applications into Warm Introductions.
**Paragraph:** You aren't competing against the entire internet anymore. We specifically source roles from companies with a proven track record of hiring alumni from *your exact university and program*. 
**Visual:** A data visualization showing an arrow from "UT Dallas Business School" to "Toyota HQ."

## Section 4: Social Proof / Trust
**Headline:** Built for Students who want Authenticity, not Automation.
**Testimonial (Mocked):** *"I used to spend 3 hours a day copying job descriptions into ChatGPT to see if I should apply. Now I just open the app, look at the 5 jobs it pre-matched to my TPM resume, and apply in 10 minutes." - Graduating Senior, Class of 2026*
