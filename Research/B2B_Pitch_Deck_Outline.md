# B2B Pitch Deck Outline: The Curriculum-to-Career Platform

## Slide 1: Title Slide
- **Headline:** Bridging the Gap Between Academia and Industry.
- **Sub-headline:** Moving beyond job boards to verifiable curriculum-to-career alignment.
- **Visual:** A bridge connecting a University building (Syllabus) to a Corporate HQ (Job Description).

## Slide 2: The Problem for Higher Ed
- **Headline:** Universities are flying blind after graduation.
- **Bullet 1:** Career outcomes drive enrollment and accreditation, but universities lack real-time data on *why* students fail to get hired.
- **Bullet 2:** Legacy platforms like Handshake only report *who* got hired, creating a lagging indicator.
- **Bullet 3:** Student trust in "Spray and Pray" AI tools (JobRight) is leading to recruiter blacklists and damaged university reputations.

## Slide 3: The Solution
- **Headline:** Curriculum-Backed Intelligence.
- **Concept:** A platform that evaluates students against real-time job descriptions using their *verified course projects and syllabi*, not just AI-generated resume buzzwords.
- **Visual:** Comparison chart: **Old Way (Handshake/JobRight):** Keyword Matching -> Recruiter Rejection. **New Way:** Syllabus Mapping -> Verified Gap Analysis -> Hired.

## Slide 4: Value Proposition for the Department Head (The Buyer)
- **Headline:** Turn Career Data into Enrollment ROI.
- **Syllabus Optimization:** Receive automated reports on the Top 5 trending skills in your field.
- **Enrollment Strategy:** Prove the ROI of a specific elective. Example: "Adding an Agile module to IE 5301 will increase student match rates for DFW-area PM roles by 15%."
- **Accreditation Proof:** Generate instant reports mapping student skill acquisition to ABET or AACSB requirements via real job outcomes.

## Slide 5: Value Proposition for the Student (The User)
- **Headline:** From "Cold" Applications to "Warm" Sourcing.
- **Stop Applying into the Void:** We source jobs exclusively from companies that actively hired your alumni last year.
- **Prescriptive Gap Analysis:** Don't just get rejected. We tell you exactly what course to take next semester to fix the gap in your resume.

## Slide 6: The Competitive Moat
- **Headline:** Authenticity is the New Premium.
- **JobRight & LinkedIn:** Optimize for speed, leading to AI Hallucinations ("Lying to pass ATS"). Recruiters are filtering these out.
- **Our Platform:** Optimizes for Verifiability. We match based on graded university projects.
- **Data Defensibility:** B2C competitors cannot access internal syllabus and transcript data.

## Slide 7: Go-to-Market Strategy & Business Model
- **Pricing:** B2B SaaS model sold to University Departments or Central Career Services.
- **Phase 1 (The Proving Ground):** Pilot at University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) targeting highly technical programs (Engineering, Data Science) where skill gaps are measurable.
- **Phase 2 (The Expansion):** Scale to University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). UTD currently relies heavily on Handshake for their Career Center; we will position our product as the intelligence layer sitting *above* their existing job board.
- **Phase 3 (Ecosystem Integration):** Integrate directly with University LMS (Canvas/Blackboard) across the UT System for automated project ingestion.

## Slide 8: Case Study / MVP Validation
- **Headline:** The "Warm" Sourcing Difference.
- **Data Point:** Compare [Cold Sourcing Response Rate %] vs. [Alumni-Sourced Pipeline Response Rate %].
- **Call to Action:** "Partner with us for a Fall Semester Pilot to map your Senior Capstone projects against the 2026 hiring market."
